    "\n",
    "Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is a key metric in medical imaging that tells us how reliable a positive test result is. It answers the question: \"When the test says there's something there, how often is it actually there?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PPV is calculated as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "PPV = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "PPV works together with other metrics:\n",
    "- Sensitivity tells us how good a test is at finding actual problems\n",
    "- Specificity shows how good it is at ruling out problems that aren't there\n",
    "- Modality concordance looks at when different imaging methods agree with each other\n",
    "\n",
    "For parathyroid imaging, high PPV means we can trust positive findings to guide surgery. When multiple imaging methods agree (concordance), it often increases our confidence in the results.\n"
